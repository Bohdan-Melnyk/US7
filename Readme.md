Simple tests to cover two methods: convertStudents and calculateScore. Also there is Utils class where
there are two simple static methods to create Students and Players.

Tests run from IntelliJ Idea by from the class near the class name or button from the top.
Possible to run test one at a time. If it needs test can run with coverage.
